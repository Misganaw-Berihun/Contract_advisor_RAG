# Contract_advisor_RAG
## Introduction

This project builds a question-and-answer (Q&A) pipeline for extracting information from legal contracts. It leverages the power of RAG (Retriever-Augmented Generator) with Langchain and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate and efficient access to contractual knowledge.

## Project Goal

* Create a high-performing, accurate, and user-friendly Q&A system for contracts.
* Achieve target performance metrics in terms of accuracy, relevance, and response time.

## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* Langchain library
* A dataset of contracts and corresponding Q&A pairs
